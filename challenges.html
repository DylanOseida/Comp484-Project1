          Game development has been one of the most fun things I've worked on, 
          but also one of the hardest. I've faced challenges with <strong>design</strong>, 
          <strong>technical skills</strong>, and <strong>motivation</strong>. 
          Each has taught me something new and shaped how I approach making games.

        <h3>My Main Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Design Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              I never really created my own models or textures. I tried <strong>Blender</strong> and 
              <strong>Krita</strong>, but I never completed anything. Design takes a lot of time, and 
              I dont usually have the motivation for it. Roblox Studio made design much easier, because I 
              could use simple shapes to build fun levels quickly, and it still felt like my own design.

          <li>
            <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              As a beginner, I often wasn't sure which tools to use in engines like Unity or Godot. 
              Unity's <strong>C#</strong> coding was something I practiced, but I didnt know how to use 
              Godot's system at all. Going at it solo meant I relied heavily on YouTube tutorials.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even in Roblox, I run into technical problems. For example, I struggle with events, tweening, 
              and especially with <abbr title="Delta Time">DT</abbr> when trying to make object movement smooth.

              -     <meter> for motivation scale        -

              -                                         -

          <li>
            <h4>Motivation Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              Motivation is my hardest challenge. Every time I hit a big technical wall, I take a break 
              and sometimes I don't come back for months.
            </p>
            <p>Here's my current motivation meter to get back into game development:</p>
            <meter value="60" min="0" max="100" low="30" high="70" optimum="100">
              40%
            </meter>
            <p>And here's my current progress on my Roblox game:</p>
            <progress value="7" max="10">70%</progress>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Lessons Learned -->
        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>
          I've learned the most from Roblox Studio and the Udemy class I took. Udemy helped me 
          understand technical details like <abbr title="frames per second">FPS</abbr>, collision boxes, 
          and rigidbodies. Roblox taught me about game design the most, more specifically, planning ahead before building, setting goals, 
          and keeping levels consistent.
