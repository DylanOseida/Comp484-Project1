          Game development is an exciting but complex process. Developers face 
          many challenges that can range from technical obstacles to creative 
          design issues and even personal motivation. Understanding these 
          challenges helps explain why games are difficult to make and why 
          finishing a project is such an achievement.

        <h3>Common Challenges in Game Development</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Design Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              Designing fun, engaging levels and mechanics can be one of the 
              hardest parts of game development. Creating original assets in 
              tools like <strong>Blender</strong> or <strong>Krita</strong> 
              takes time and skill. Even with engines like Roblox Studio, 
              developers must carefully balance <em>simplicity</em> with 
              <em>creativity</em> to make games that players enjoy.

          <li>
            <h4>Technical Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              Game engines like Unity, Godot, and Unreal provide powerful tools, 
              but learning them can be overwhelming for beginners. Developers 
              often struggle with coding mechanics such as movement, physics, 
              or animation. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Even simple issues like event handling, scripting logic, or 
              implementing <abbr title="Delta Time">DT</abbr> correctly can 
              cause problems. Debugging is a constant part of the process, and 
              most developers spend a lot of time testing and fixing errors.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li>
            <h4>Motivation Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              Game development requires patience and long-term commitment. 
              Many developers lose motivation when they hit technical roadblocks 
              or when projects grow too ambitious. Staying consistent is often 
              harder than solving any single programming or design problem.
            </p>
            <p>Here's a visualization of common motivation levels during a project:</p>
            <meter value="40" min="0" max="100" low="30" high="70" optimum="100">
              40%
            </meter>
            <p>And here's an example of progress tracking on a small project:</p>
            <progress value="3" max="10">30%</progress>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Lessons from Challenges</h3>
        <p>
          Although game development is full of obstacles, overcoming them is 
          what helps developers grow. Struggling with design builds creativity, 
          debugging teaches patience and problem-solving, and pushing through 
          low motivation builds persistence. These challenges make the process 
          difficult but also rewarding, and they are part of why finishing a 
          game is such an accomplishment.
