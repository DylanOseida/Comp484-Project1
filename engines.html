            <h2>Roblox Studio</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          Roblox Studio is the engine I’ve used the most. I have an almost complete game with 
          <strong>10 levels</strong> designed — only missing a proper UI, a lobby, and some technical polish.
          Roblox scripting uses <abbr title="Lightweight, easy-to-learn scripting language">Lua</abbr>, 
          which I’ve learned mainly through tutorials on YouTube (like <em>The Dev King</em>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Roblox Studio is free to use, has a beginner-friendly UI, simple modeling tools, real-time 
          collaboration with friends, and makes importing models easy.

            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Godot_icon.svg/1200px-Godot_icon.svg.png?20170822201738">
            <h2>Godot</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I’ve explored Godot mostly through tutorials (Brackeys, for example). I only attempted one project 
          and didn’t get far, but it was fun and feels like a strong next step after Roblox. 
          Godot is <strong>open-source</strong> (like Blender), free, and has grown a lot in popularity recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s beginner-friendly but also has complex features similar to Unity.

            <h2>Unity</h2>
        </div>
        <p>
          I’ve followed a Udemy course and made some small mini-games in Unity. I’ve only worked in 
          <strong>2D</strong>, not 3D. It felt more challenging than Roblox or Godot, and while I never made a 
          game fully on my own, I did start making my own assets for practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unity is free (with paid tiers for professionals), uses <strong>C#</strong> as its main scripting 
          language, and is a good step into intermediate game development.

            <h2>Unreal Engine</h2>
        </div>        
        <p>
          I haven’t built anything myself in UE5, but I’ve seen many demos and videos of it in action.
          Unreal Engine is known for <strong>AAA-quality graphics</strong>, powerful 3D capabilities, and uses 
          <strong>C++</strong> and <strong>Blueprints</strong> for scripting.
        </p>
        <p>
          It’s more complex than the engines I’ve used so far, but it’s an industry-standard engine used in 
          high-end professional game development.
