          One of the most common “projects” in game development is participating 
          in a <strong>game jam</strong>. A game jam is an event where developers 
          come together to create a game in a limited amount of time, usually within a week. 
          These events focus on creativity, rapid prototyping, and teamwork.

          <h3>What is a Game Jam?</h3>
          <p>
            A game jam is like a hackathon, but for video games. Participants are 
            given a theme, a time limit, and then challenged to create a game from 
            scratch. The emphasis is not on creating a polished, perfect product, 
            but on experimenting, learning, and finishing something playable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some of the most famous jams include the 
            <strong>Global Game Jam</strong>, <strong>Brackeys Game Jam</strong>, and 
            <strong>GMTK Game Jam</strong>. These usually have thousands 
            of participants from all over the world.

          <h3>How a Game Jam Works</h3>
          <p>
            Even though every jam is different, they follow a similar structure:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Announcement of a theme (example: "Risk it for the Biscuit" from <em>Brackeys Game Jam 2025.2</em>).</li>
            <li>Brainstorming ideas.</li>
            <li>Prototyping and development of the game.</li>
            <li>Playtesting and last-minute polish.</li>
            <li>Submission of the game.</li>
          </ol>

          <h3>Reflection on Game Jams</h3>
          <p>
            Game jams are one of the best ways to gain experience in game 
            development. They emphasize <em>creativity</em>, <em>problem-solving</em>, 
            and <em>teamwork</em> more than technical perfection. Many professional 
            developers recommend them as a way to practice finishing projects — 
            even small, simple ones — and to build confidence as a game maker.
