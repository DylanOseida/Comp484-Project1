        <!-- Intro -->
        <p>
          Through game development I picked up a wide variety of skills, 
          both technical and creative. Some came from trial and error, 
          others from watching countless YouTube tutorials or experimenting 
          inside game engines. Each engine taught me something different, 
          and together these skills helped me grow as a developer.

        <!-- Languages -->
        <section>
          <h3>Languages Learned</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>C#</strong> (Unity)</li>
            <li><strong>Lua</strong> (Roblox Studio)</li>
            <li><strong>GDScript</strong> (Godot)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Learning three languages gave me exposure to different styles of 
            coding. Lua was simple, C# was stricter but powerful, and GDScript 
            felt similar to Python.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Technical -->
        <section>
          <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
          <p>
            I learned how to debug problems in Roblox Studio by printing to the 
            output window. One major issue I solved was character movement inside 
            cylinders. The collision wasnâ€™t working until I discovered how to 
            change <em>Collision Fidelity</em> to 
            <code>PreciseConvexDecomposition</code>. That let characters walk 
            properly inside curved objects.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also got better at recognizing common engine tools like physics 
            components, rigidbodies, and frame rate considerations.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Design -->
        <section>
          <h3>Design Skills</h3>
          <p>
            Designing levels was harder than I expected. I didnâ€™t want levels 
            to be too simple, but I also wanted each to feel unique. I eventually 
            added a <strong>sprint mechanic</strong> in Roblox so players could 
            quickly dodge enemies in short bursts.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also learned to think about pacing and flow â€” making levels 
            progressively harder and balancing challenge with fun.
          </p>

        <!-- Art -->
        <section>
          <h3>Art & Asset Creation</h3>
          <p>
            I experimented with Blender and Krita. While I didnâ€™t get far with 
            Blender, I did make two pixel art assets in Krita: a <strong>soda can</strong> 
            and a <strong>fighter airplane</strong> (like Snoopyâ€™s daydream plane). 
            I even figured out how to import them into Unity and use them as assets.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- Collaboration -->
        <section>
          <h3>Collaboration</h3>
          <p>
            I collaborated in real-time once with a friend. It wasnâ€™t a big 
            project, but it taught me how to use Roblox Studioâ€™s collaboration 
            features. I also got to show him some basics of scripting and 
            simple 3D modeling, which made me realize I could teach others.

        <!-- Soft Skills -->
        <section>
          <h3>Soft & Transferable Skills</h3>
          <p>
            Beyond the technical side, I built valuable soft skills:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Debugging and problem-solving on my own</li>
            <li>Project planning and design organization</li>
            <li>Persistence through trial-and-error</li>
            <li>Learning independently through tutorials</li>
            <li>Creativity and storytelling through levels</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <!-- Reflection -->
        <section>
          <h3>Reflection</h3>
          <p>
            Overall, I grew as a game developer by learning coding, design, 
            and creative thinking. Every project gave me something new to 
            carry forward.
